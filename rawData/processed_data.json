Africana studies, while still relatively young, has a vibrant history that traces the lives and scholarship of people from African descent. Its complex and latent development in academia follows from the socio-political marginalization of people within the African diaspora. Nevertheless, resilience and perseverance will be repeated themes as we study how, through different techniques and modes of understanding, people of the African diaspora have continually challenged the western hegemony of academic study.\n",

Closely reading texts, television, music, comedy, and artistic works from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, we will think through some of the processes by which black women's bodies are socially, politically, and culturally constructed as dangerous, disruptive, and out of control. Another major goal of the course is to consider the various strategies black women take up to foreground pleasure, and various ways of seeing black bodies as healthy and adequate. We can do so by examining competing versions of 'black womanhood,' looking at how ideas about the discourse  circulate around the hegemonic idea of black women and black femininity as unruly.

ANTH 101 is designed to familiarize the student with several distinct, but inter-related aspects of archaeological method and theory. Archaeology has developed its own history in relation to anthropology and needs to be contextualized within this background. The field has also developed its own distinct methods based on reconnaissance, excavation, and analysis. All archaeology is interpretive and reliant upon the methods utilized to collect data as well as upon the theoretical backgrounds, assumptions, and analyses that are applied. Archaeologists must also be concerned with a host of ethical questions that are of concern to field research in the present. This course hopes to provide a background to understanding the uses of archaeological theory by specifically emphasizing the ways in which material culture can be utilized to make interpretations concerning both past and present behavior.

It seeks to provide a definition of their common cultural background and to examine the archaeological record for the origins of these various societies and their rise into complex indigenous civilizations that were finally dismantled following contact with the Spanish in the sixteenth century. Emphasis will be placed on the nature of the archaeological interpretation of these native American cultures and on the diachronic and dynamic relationships between highland Mexican and lowland Maya groups.

Intellectually, it aims to introduce students to some of the ways anthropologists have thought about the processes and politics of writing about culture(s) and people(s).  Required for Scripps anthropology majors choosing the sociocultural track, the course is open (with the instructor's permission) to students whose thesis or other major writing project would be enhanced by an examination of the issues and debates surrounding ethnographic writing.  \n",

        "courseDescription": "This course examines the normative and political dilemmas of citizenship and belonging through the lived experiences of Latino/a communities in the United States. Citizenship is typically thought of as state-granted universal membership in the national community with a guarantee of equality through civil, political, and social rights. However, citizenship is also a terrain of social struggle in which marginalized groups contest their exclusion. Historically, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and other non-Whites have been restricted from full and equal standing in the nation. The high growth-rate of Latino/as since the 1970s has further challenged the notion of liberal inclusion. The key issue of undocumented migration and controversies over 'illegality' further complicate the significance of Latino citizenship within the borders of the United States. This class will incorporate interdisciplinary scholarship, focusing on how Latino/as have claimed rights in the shadow of citizenship. We will draw from legal and political theory, feminist theory, and critical race theory, as well as ethnographies and case studies that surface how citizenship is enacted and embodied. By the end of the course, students will understand the origins of nation-state citizenship, the role that race, gender, class, and labor played in shaping the legal parameters of American citizenship. Students will also be able to analyze how globalization, migration, and U.S. foreign and economic policies have challenged and transformed citizenship. Finally, students will analyze the different ways that subaltern communities have redefined citizenship through in their daily lives.",

By doing so, we will interrogate how race, gender, class, ability and community shape the rates of, and the quality of political participation and activism amongst Latino/a/x communities. While various forms of activism such as union activism, anti-war activism, student activism, and civil rights activism all have appeared within the broader category of \"Latino/a\" social movements, we will pay special attention to the contemporary immigrants' rights movement as exemplary of the modes of rights claiming practices that have defined Latino/a social movements historically.

Students develop floristic relationships through field-based creative exercises in and around the Claremont Colleges. At the end of the course students propose active solutions for appreciating the value of the botanical world. ",

        "courseDescription": "Maps have the power to reveal relationships that are not readily seen, such as uneven impacts of COVID-19, global climate change, environmental pollution, and so on. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) act as the unseen infrastructures for gathering, managing, and analyzing data that is or can be mapped, that is connected to some part of the world. GIS can be applied broadly in multiple domains to create maps that guide policymakers, businesses, communities, and individuals to make important decisions.  In recent years, these tools have increased in sophistication allowing us to model complex socio-spatial relationships while simplifying the processes involved with easy-to-follow drop-down menus and an increasing array of off-the-shelf plug-ins for mobile and desktop applications. Collectively these transformations have enabled an expanded user-base to enter the world of map-making. Yet, how do we ensure that these tools are (re)oriented toward the ends of creating a more ecologically and socially just world? In this course, you will develop a solid foundation on the commonly used processes for creating static and interactive maps that reflect hidden inequalities and disparities; as well as highlight hopeful imaginations of a more just world. In order to reach these aims, this course takes a student-centered approach, grounded in critical pedagogies and anti-racist frameworks. Students will work with the instructor and their peers to develop a collective model of engagement that values the contributions of all classroom participants and allows for an individualized assessment of growth in developing fluency of the complex mix of technological tools and theoretical understandings that undergird GIS.This course will provide an introduction and overview of GIS; specifically, ESRI WebGIS and ArcGIS mapping software; to demonstrate the basic analysis of spatial data for those interested in answering questions about the spatial significance of environmental justice, racial inequality, hazard exposure, and health equit",

With Pitzer\u2019s Outback Preserve, Bernard Field Station, and proximity to the California desert, the course emphasizes California\u2019s vast arid bioregion as a generative source for ecological art & design. Students engage theory and praxis across the arts and sciences to propose art works/designs that heal degraded ecosystems. The course has a strong naturalist component: students will keep visual and written records of their creative journey in a sketchbook, an artwork in itself. Students will develop an artistic hypothesis and depict ecological restoration as an art form. ",

Economics is widely applied in government and the private sector, in the form of Health Economics, to understand and address these widely known problems including how to address COVID-19.? Have you ever wondered why health care costs so much in the USA or why pharmaceuticals cost so much?? Have you ever wondered how health insurance works and why Health Insurance is a good thing but why so many people are uninsured or what happens when someone cannot afford health insurance?? Have you ever wondered why there are so many disparities in health by race and income or why health is better when the economy is flourishing than in a recession? Did you know that African Americans, Native Americans, and Latinos are more likely to die from COVID-19 than individuals who are white? Have you wondered why that may be and what can be done about it?? Have you ever wondered whether economics might provide insights into how to address the number of people with behavioral health or mental health issues? Have you wondered what is being done to address those individuals whose mental health has deteriorated due to COVID-19?? Have you ever wondered whether economics could be used to reduce the number of people who smoke and vape and thus threaten the health of themselves and others?? Have you ever wondered why there was a shortage or providers to treat various conditions or why doctors and hospitals have been devastated financially due to COVID-19 and may close?This course will explain how fundamental economic concepts such as supply, demand, monopoly and market power, risk and insurance, substitutes and complements, externalities, taxation and cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis, can be used to better understand and solve some of these huge and devastating health issues in our society. It also will explain how basic economic concepts influence human behavior and impact personal health through decisions regarding how much care to get from doctors, emergency rooms and hosp",

In particular, this course will focus on the role that institutions (or lack of) have on the economic development in the region, and how other economic factors have affected the long run performance of the region. Among the topics covered by this course are: the legacy of colonialism, inequality and internal strife; industrialization, unionization, corporatism, and political protectionism; the post-war years, import substitution and foreign debt, and the limits and challenges of neoliberalism.

This course will introduce and develop various concepts, including: Strategies, Payoffs, Players, Rationality and various concepts of Equilibrium which will help us analyze strategic behavior by individuals and firms. These concepts will be illustrated using a variety of economic models from industrial organization such as: oligopoly, bankruptcy law, takeover deterrents, collusion in the stock  market, patent races, auctions, bargaining and models of asymmetric information such as principal-agent and the \"lemon\" problem. We will analyze famous games like the prisoner's dilemma, the battle of the sexes, and the voting decision. Prerequisites: Economics 101 and 120 or equivalent.\n",

It examines why governments seem to abuse natural resources willfully, what forms of privatization hold promise for better resource use, what fiscal and governance arrangements are optimal for the relationship between government and state natural-resource agencies, and whether resource abundance is actually a \"curse\" rather than an advantage for a country's economic and political development. The cases will be drawn predominantly from Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Also listed as Government 132e. Prerequisites: Economics 101 and Government 20.",

        "courseDescription": "This course uses an economic perspective to analyze demographic change, including recent dramatic changes in fertility, mortality and marriage in both industrialized and developing countries.  Microeconomic models are used to analyze individual and household decisions regarding demographic behavior, including fertility, marriage and family organization, human capital investment (health and education), migration, and labor force behavior, as well as many factors that influence or are otherwise related to these outcomes.  We will examine causes and consequences of changes in human populations (e.g., size, age structure, gender balance, health, wealth) using an economic framework. Causes and consequences of variations across time, space and subgroups in fertility, mortality, family structure, human capital investment, labor force involvement and migration will be considered, as will impacts on populations and subgroups of natural disasters, wars, pandemics, macroeconomic events, government policies, technology change, and changes in human longevity.  Demographic and economic data for a wide variety of countries are used to demonstrate the interaction between economic and demographic change at the macro level.  We will analyze implications for public pension systems, health systems, economic growth, the environment, inter-group conflict, and government budgets.  Basic techniques of demographic measurement and mathematical demography are covered, with emphasis on hands-on analysis and presentation of demographic and economic data. Letter grade only.

It is the central argument of this class that close reading allows us to understand poetic and fictional worlds according to their discrete and unique logic; it is the political gamble of this course that close reading the worlds of fiction and poetry permits us to see 'this' world?the actual, real, or historical world?in its capacity to be otherwise.  Readings will range from Isabella Whitney, George Herbert, and John Donne to Shirley Jackson, Aimee Bender, and Carmen Maria Machado.  We will watch a few films (Hitchcock's Rope and Lamorisse's The Red Balloon) and we will read example of close reading from the visual arts (e.g. T.J. Clark).",

What would it mean to think of \"romance\" as a mode or instrument of inquiry, a tool of epistemology, a form or set of forms with which writers and readers of the early modern period came to know the world as it was, as it might be, and as it should be?

The class will also consider writing about novels-from both 19th-century writers and later scholars-giving particular attention to accounts of what distinguishes \"the American Novel\"\ufffd from other national traditions, especially the English novel. It will also consider the limitations of accounts that understand the development of the novel in such national terms. In addition, this course will offer an introduction to the subfield of 20th and 21st-century literary theory known as \"theory of the novel.\"\ufffd We will both consider how these theories of the genre illuminate the novels that we are reading and consider the ways in which these grand theories of the novel cannot account for the genre as it developed in the US.

We will explore the reader's role as ward, and we will glance at guardianship's bearing on histories of slavery, voting rights, and aesthetics, on contemporary problems such as mass incarceration and our failing stewardship of the earth, and on the novel genre's many debts to drama.",

In a sense, as the literary theorist Catherine Gallagher has observed, novels helped create the modern idea of fictionality, acclimatizing readers for the first time to narratives that were plausible but not truthful. How, then, are we to understand recurrent attempts to produce a 'nonfiction novel' in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries (clustering in the 1960s and 70s, the heyday of the New Journalism, and in the 2010s, the era of 'autofiction')? Should this hybrid form be classified as a species of nonfiction journalism that borrows some of the formal techniques and cultural prestige of the novel, while continuing to be bound by the strictures and standards of factual reporting? Or do nonfiction novels lie closer to the heart of the novel's tradition, given the form's historical origins in a hazy gray area between reality and artifice, fiction and fact? Assigned authors may include Madeleine de Scud\ufffdry, Daniel Defoe, Marcel Proust, Ka-tzetnik 135633, Truman Capote, Norman Mailer, Michael Herr, Ryszard Kapu\ufffdci\ufffdski, Danilo Kis, W.G.

In it, students will become familiar with a wide range of prose storytelling techniques, both traditional and experimental. They will also engage with a variety of storytelling genres, including not only fiction and memoir but also film, photography, and song, and though this process of creative discovery, they will hone their intuition for narrative craft and explore what animates them as writers. Over the semester students will draft and revise a portfolio of short stories or a single longer work of narrative prose. \n\nThis course meets the senior seminar requirement for Scripps English majors (please see \u201cSenior Requirement in the English major\u201d in the catalog) but is open to all students. It may be repeated once for credit.",

The first semester focuses on the connections and distinctions between continuous-time and discrete-time signals and systems and their representation in the time and frequency domains. Topics include impulse response, convolution, continuous and discrete Fourier series and transforms, and frequency response. Current applications, including filtering, modulation and sampling, are presented, and simulation techniques based on both time and frequency domain representations are introduced. In the second semester additional analysis and design tools based on the Laplace- and z-transforms are developed, and the state space formulation of continuous and discrete-time systems is presented. Concepts covered during both semesters are applied in a comprehensive treatment of feedback control systems including performance criteria, stability, observability, controllability, compensation and pole placement.

        "courseDescription": "The emphasis of this course is on exposure to the latest or up to date technological literature on advanced processing of engineered materials, critical analysis of the literature, and improvement of communicational skills (both oral and written) so critical for your career development. You will need to be self-reliant to succeed.\n\nAdvanced manufacturing is the backbone of most industries and the productivity of anindustry or country depends significantly on the development and implementation of newtechnologies as one faces challenges globally. Much of the technical information on newtechnologies is available in the patent literature (U.S. Patents) (a resource hardly tapped) and some fundamental work in the technical literature. Magazine articles and the worldwide web (www) generally cover the overall features. Students in this course will have an opportunity to explore the latest advances in manufacturing processes first hand, which would otherwise take\nyears before it appears in textbooks. Where appropriate, industry experts will provide guest presentations and an on-site tour may be incorporated. No required textbook; only reference material.\n\nTopics covered in this course may include, purification of materials [electro-slag remelting (ESR), vacuum melting, zone refining, melting to remove tramp elements]; precision casting; densification of materials (conventional sintering, reaction sintering, hot-pressing, hot-isostatic pressing); directional solidification and growth of single crystals (Czochralski process and Bridgeman technique); mechanical alloying; liquid phase infiltration; net-shaped finishing; superplastic forming; processing of nanocrystalline materials (sol-gel processing); float glass or flat glass processing; tape laying; microwave processing; laser processing; ultraprecision machining (UPM) and ultraprecision grinding (UPG); polishing and lapping; engineered surfaces and surface modification [CVD and PVD (sputtering and ion plating) coatings including multilayer coatings]; and layer processing for electronic materials. These and other topics the students may choose are rarely exposed, if at all, and definitely not at the same depth, to typical engineering students. You will receive a list of some 20 case studies as examples and a one-\npage description of each topic outlining the resources available, such as U. S. Patents or technical literature, as guidelines. You are free to choose any topic from this list or some other topic of interest. In most cases, students pick additional topics. \n\nThis is an open ended course where students receive the opportunity to select a topic of interest dealing with advanced processing, prepare a patent search, analyze patents, prepare a technical report, and present the results in a power point presentation (PPT) format to the entire class. This way, in addition to acquiring knowledge on various manufacturing processes and materials, students improve upon their analytical and communicational skills (both written and oral). Students have the option to form a team of two or work individually. During the span of the course,\n-conduct three case studies. Each case study takes 4-5 weeks.\n-Each week, make a PPT on the progress of your work and\n-on the last week of each case study, make final presentations and submit technical reports.\n\nAt the beginning of the course, the students were given a list of anticipated ABET program outcomes. Depending on the topic chosen by a particular student, the relevance of these outcomes vary. At the end of the semester, the students are given a questionnaire, which is essentially the same as the outcomes given at the beginning of the course. The only difference is after each outcome, two items were included, namely, students\ufffd analysis before and after the course (in a scale of 1-10) for self-assessment. These are anonymous and submitted to the Secretary. That way confidentiality is maintained.\nPrerequisite: Engineering 86. ",

Where? Why? This course introduces students to some of the leading critical approaches to the geographies of labor, including Marxist political economy and feminist, critical-race, anticolonial and queer theories. This course investigates a number of contemporary shifts in the organization of work, including the rise of neoliberalism, deindustrialization, the feminization of the paid labor force, the prevalence of precarious work, contemporary forms of labor migration, and the expansion of prison labor. Locating these shifts in the longer histories and geographies of unfree labor, students will examine some of the ways in which workers have used their labor as a departure point for collective action, including unionization, work refusals, and struggles over social reproduction.",

How can geology help us to trace the invention of tools, the development of complex trade routes, and even the invention of art? How did interactions with prehistoric beasts shape our world, inform our legends, and lead to the domestic plants and animals of today? And finally how have changing climates left their mark on both the rock record and archaeological record, driving the ascension and collapse of civilizations? Letter grade only.

It employs the policy sciences framework to explore the political and economic-policy challenges of minimizing the abuse of resource endowments due to mis-pricing, corruption, intra-governmental conflicts, and perverse governance arrangements. It examines why governments seem to abuse natural resources willfully, what forms of privatization hold promise for better resource use, what fiscal and governance arrangements are optimal for the relationship between government and state natural-resource agencies, and whether resource abundance is actually a \"curse\" rather than an advantage for a country's economic and political development. The cases will be drawn predominantly from Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Also listed as Economics 142. Prerequisites: Economics 101 and Government 20. ",

The vexed relationship between church and state is at the heart of public debates regarding education, marriage, and numerous other issues. To illuminate current debates we will examine the philosophical and political arguments for separation and how these have played out over the course of American constitutional history.

Based on a blend of sources, this cultural-studies course provides a survey of the current state of race relations and racial discourse in the German-speaking countries. It draws on input from literary texts, discussions in media, presentations in film and other visuals, and experiences in daily life. A key goal of the course is, beyond the broad content focus on questions of race, migration, xenophobia, class, and DEI, to offer an alternative view of these topics beyond the US-American debate. Many students are doubtlessly already acquainted with the latter, and the course provides a new lens on these questions through the cultural historical parameters of a different country/culture. Lastly, the course also presents national and transnational efforts (for instance via the EU) to address the social ills of racism and discrimination.",

Racial capitalism as a framework recognizes that capitalism is inherently social and that capitalist value production has thrived on the violent and violative production of social and spatial difference and separability. We will learn from interdisciplinary scholars that have asked and investigated how and where categories of difference like race, class, gender, and sexuality are in productive tension with the relations of property, ownership, and capitalist value. We will learn about abolition democracy as a political intellectual model that precedes and exceeds the developmental model of racial capitalism by grounding abolition democracy within Black and Indigenous studies and Gender and Sexuality studies. Abolition democracy is not just a response to racial capitalism and racist violence, but is a way of being and knowing that offers insights to some of our most pressing social concerns.",

Students will examine the formation of Asian American genders and sexualities alongside histories of racialization, migration, and labor that span East, South, and Southeast Asian, as well as Pacific contexts. In our engagement with transpacific movements of people and culture, we will foreground settler colonial occupations of the Pacific Islands and highlight the work of decolonial queer-feminist thinkers like Haunani-Kay Trask, Maile Arvin, and Stephanie Nohelani Teves. We will attend to the incommensurability of migrant and indigenous frameworks, even as we move through the persistence and at times concurrence of multiple forms of colonialism that connect Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. Some questions we will address include: How do historical contexts (i.e. the Cold War, 9/11, Japanese internment) affect Asian American gender formations? What does the popular (Orientalist depictions of Asian women from Geisha Girl to Tiger Mom) have to do with the geo-political (U.S. economic relations with Asia)? How might an Asian American queer politics reveal the limitations of the model minority myth? How can centering Pacific Islander onto-epistemologies decolonize notions of gender and sexuality?",

In this course we will explore how common narratives of heroism and of the well-lived life shaped the political and cultural histories of the Mediterranean world from 3000 B.C.E. to 400 C.E., from the rise of the earliest Ancient Near Eastern empires through the decline of the Roman Empire. There will be a strong emphasis on engaging with the ancient sources in translation, with readings drawn especially from the genres of epic (Homer's Iliad, Epic of Gilgamesh, Hesiod's Works & Days), historiography (Herodotus, Thucydides, Sallust, Livy, Tacitus), and biography (Law Code of Hammurabi, Xenophon's Agesilaus, Plutarch's Lives, and the Passion of Perpetua).",

Then we will turn to the creators of cuisines\ufffdchefs\ufffdand ask how have their culinary decisions affected the environment? The third section will consider the way restaurants market themselves and ask what do their representations reveal about their relationships with the environment. And the last section will focus on the important farm-to-table movement and ask how, if at all, has it changed prevailing views of food and the environment? Letter grade only.

Of late \"convivencia\" has become the focus of increased attention, as people in the post-9/11 world turn to history for signs of hope that Christians, Muslims and Jews really can get along. In this course we will take a critical and nuanced look at the idea of \"convivencia\" and how it relates to the historical realities of medieval Spain. Letter grade only.

Lectures and discussions will delve into specific topics, such as the role of racism, anti-Semitism and biopolitics, the psychological responses of victims, the inclusion of rape as a genocidal war crime, the response of bystanders, perpetrator motivation, and trends in post-genocidal societies such as trials, memorialization and compensation.\n",

One of those ghosts is Karl Marx, who has reappeared to haunt the present. But he wrote in the 19th century, for an audience of a different time and place. So the question arises: what remains relevant from his writings? What do we salvage and what do we discard? Reading him intensively, with an eye to present conundrums, and in concert with Thomas Piketty, we will attempt to answer some of those questions together. ",

Focusing particularly on the arrival of European economic migrants to the largest settler-republics in the Americas, Canada, the U.S., Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina, and Brazil, this class takes an inter-disciplinary approach in its study of European diasporas. Through close readings of key works in historical, sociological, anthropological, and political analyses of whiteness/whitening, settler colonialism/republicanism, racial formation, and critical race theory, this class examines the development of European diasporas in the Americas as products of conquest, settler colonialism, trans-Atlantic slavery, and the Enlightenment; the uses and consequences of whiteness and whitening ideologies; and the political uses of whiteness and its consequences in public policy.

Many of the texts are classics of Latin American culture, such as the chronicles of the 1500s, the words of Rigoberta Menchu during the 1980s genocide in Guatemala, and the challenge of Zapatista rebels in Chiapas to build a world with dignity for all. Among the subjects we will explore are oral histories of the poor as a source for talking about national history; changing approaches toward racial identities across recent decades; centering campesino and working-class gender perspectives; Zapatista challenges to heterosexism; counter-hegemonic conceptions of time and space.\n",

It resists categorization and registers different ways of thinking about the world and one\u2019s place in it; it typcally blends documentary, experimental, and narrative elements into hybrid and subjective articulations. The course aims to combine theorizing the role of the \u201cessayistic\u201d and the formal analysis of the essay film, along with an informed sense of what the \u201cessay\u201d does. We explore the possible histories of the essay film and study the relationship among essays, the essayistic, and the essay film through a series of case studies. Readings include work by Virginia Woolf, James Baldwin, Susan Sontag, Michel de Montaigne, Hito Steyerl, and Theodor Adorno. Possible filmmakers include Dziga Vertov, Alexander Kluge, ChrisMarker, John Akomfrah, Harun Farocki, Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino, Agn\u00e8s Varda, Pier Paolo Pasolini, and Ja\u2019Tovia Gary.",

In this course, we will use critical theories (including critical race theory, feminism, Marxism, and others) to understand the entangled issues behind this and other persistent inequities.\n\nThe purpose of this course is to help fulfill the HMC mission statement more completely by empowering students to be engaged, critical, and civic-minded participants who can positively impact society.\n\nThis class will have a reasonable out-of-class homework requirement that will be commensurate with a one-unit course.",

For this reason, the course will not explore well known materpieces of Italian cinema, but we will instead analyze the impact of less known productions, films made for television or films that were not destined to foreign distribution, in order to analyze how Italian history has been translated in to the popular imaginary. The course will be taught entirely in Italian.",

For example, we explain why you can run up a bill and run up a hill, but while you can run a bill up, you can't run a hill up. Over the course of the semester we will adjust our theoretical model of syntax (using the framework of generative syntax), arriving at a set of claims about the nature of syntactic structures that are universal to all languages. The course emphasizes analysis and argumentation, with a writing-centric curriculum. Letter grade only. Prerequisites: LGCS 010  PO or equivalent.",

The first half of the course will consist of an introduction to language acquisition, an introduction to Tomasello's Construction Grammar (a theory of the child acquisition of syntax), and an introduction to Chomsky's Minimalist Program (a theory of adult language syntax). The second half of the course will introduce a new theory that offers an acquisition-based explanation for some core properties of adult syntax. We will read and discuss these new proposals, consider predictions of these proposals, and students will test those predictions using already existing child language data (CHILDES). The expectation is that students will have some background in relevant issues so that everything is not entirely new, and as such a variety of prerequisites are included (with the expectation that students will have taken at least one). But it is unlikely that any student will have background in all the areas that the course covers. Students ought not be deterred if they don't have exposure in some areas that the course touches on: all necessary background will be provided during the course through readings and lectures, including technical skills for using the CHILDES corpora.

Through the reading and writing of we and you texts, we will examine how these stories exploit ambiguities in narrative identity. How do readers reconcile the paradox of a singular communal voice? In second-person stories, what do we make of you's ability to simultaneously refer to the reader, a disembodied narrator, and a fictional character? Mobs, high school cliques, refugees, undercover spies, and, of course, you will narrate our course readings. The syllabus will include work by the following writers: Junot D\ufffdaz, Jennifer Egan, Mariana Enr\ufffdquez, Jeffrey Eugenides, William Faulkner, Steven Millhauser, Julie Otsuka, and Justin Torres.

        "courseDescription": "Geometry of big data, including geometric deep learning, is a new field of machine learning and big data analytics that can visualize and learn from complex data like graphs and multi-dimensional points. Most deep learning research has so far focused on dealing with 1D, 2D, or 3D Euclidean-structured data such as acoustic signals, images, or videos. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in geometric deep learning, attempting to generalize deep learning methods to non-Euclidean structured data such as graphs and manifolds, with a variety of applications from the domains of network analysis, computational social science, or computer graphics. This course includes two components, 1) geometric data analysis and 2) geometric deep learning. For 1), students will learn geometric aspects of image analysis, pattern analysis and shape analysis and the approach of multivariate statistics that treats arbitrary data sets as clouds of points in n-dimensional space. For 2), students will learn how to apply traditional machine learning methods such as convolutional neural networks to 3D objects, graphs and manifolds to solve problems including classifying nodes with similar characteristics on graphs, 3D object classification using point clouds, and 3D shape correspondence on 2D images. Prerequisites: MATH019  HM, MATH062  HM, MATH073  HM, and CSCI005  HM. Concurrent enrollment in MATH142  HM recommended but not required.",

        "courseDescription": "Machine learning (ML) is a new branch of computer science that provides services for automatic translation and speech recognition (Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant), product recommendations (Netflix, Amazon, etc.), transportation (Waymo, Tesla, the City of Copenhagen), and political campaigns (Facebook and Cambridge Analytica). ML is becoming a familiar presence in our lives; computer scientists and developers introduce new applications every day for chatting with humans, recommending the best course of action, and making predictions about the future. In spite of all the press, ML remains daunting to non-specialists. This class seeks to mend this divide. This class will introduce ML concepts to students without prior experience and provide templates to get students working in ML right away. We will study and remake artworks by Mario Klingemann, Anna Ridler, Sougwen Chung, Memo Akten, Helena Sarin, Tom White, and others. They will use techniques such as image segmentation, CycleGAN, pix2pix, and Tensorflow. Students will propose and work on a larger project in the last third of the class. Prerequisite: Any experience with programming, especially with Python\n",

Who gets to play, particularly along lines of race, gender, sexuality, and class? Live and recorded gameplay demonstrations will provide students with the material for criticism and inquiry, alongside contemporary critical games writing that will serve as models for their own writing projects. Participants do not need previous experience with games or computers, but only a willingness to engage with games and gameplay within a critical context.

Drawing upon the extensive resources of the Processing Foundation and the School of Poetic Computation and structured as a teaching practicum, students will explore digital pedagogy and curriculum development while gaining first hand experience in navigating and building digital communities. Students will work directly with Pacific Islander focused groups such as, but not limited to PIEAM, Purple Maia, and Kamehameha Schools, and will participatein a 4 hour/week for 10 week practicum placement with one or two pre-college youth.",

More than presenting a series of individual case studies, we seek and forge pathways of understanding across time period and national divide, to articulate ways in which queerness?here broadly defined as the experience of 'otherness' in gender or sexual identity relative to societal expectations?inevitably enlivens and drives forward the very cultures and characters that ostensibly serve to suppress it. In mapping European and American music's queer underground, we delve into provocative topics like operatic castration practices, eroticism in convent music, synthesizers and transgender embodiment, David Bowie's and Prince's gender-fluid personae, LGBTQIA+ roots of Disco and House (EDM), and more. Open to all students; no prior knowledge of music theory or notation required.",

Topics include democratic institutions, race, gender, class, media, parties, economics, voting behavior, voting rights, public opinion, political culture, and expertise in governing. Throughout we will draw parallels between American politics and social, political, and economic trends in other parts of the world--from advanced industrial democracies in Western Europe to uncertain democracies in Eastern Europe and Eurasia. While we pay particular attention to the elections of 2016 and 2020, we situate those events in a broader historical and global context. ",

People in all sorts of organizations\nneed to articulate what ethics are and to set up guidelines, since these do not just fall into place naturally.

Some movements captivate local imaginations\nand others go global. What creative ways have movement organizers re-configured old ideas for the new\nage and what new ones have emerged? The course is designed around three themes: What is to be done; How is it to be done; and The possibilities of what can be done.",

        "courseDescription": "This class is designed for students with no previous or very little experience in Pilates. Pilates is an abdominally based workout that is designed to create postural strength focusing on the abdominal as well as the small intrinsic muscles that support our spinal column. The entire theory of Pilates is developed around the idea of lengthening the muscles as they contract. The innovative method of exercise demands intense focus on certain muscle groups while all the time engaging the abdominals. This type of activity increases strength and flexibility around the spinal column as well as other major muscle groups. The practice of Pilates is designed to stimulate the proper neurological innervation to create a deeper sense of symmetry. P/NC only.

This course will cover the techniques, rules, tactics, and psychology of competitive fencing. Goals are to have fun, since fencing is a sport, but it is also a game. P/NC only.

This course is a general introduction to philosophy through metaphysics and epistemology.  Questions to be considered include:  Is the natural world all there is?  Do we have free will?  Is there a difference between perception and reality?  What is consciousness?  What is time?",

In this class, students explore whether seemingly objective scientific inquiry can be affected by the social and cultural values of the scientific community. Broadly, we will focus on three inter-related topics: (i) evidence gathering and inductive reasoning, (ii) science as a value-free enterprise, and (iii) the nature of technological change through the explosion of big data and machine learning. Through these topics, we examine the values implicit in scientific culture and the extent to which these values do, can, and should guide the development of burgeoning technology.",

In Western theism\nbelief in God and a belief in personal immortality are two central religious beliefs. So\nphilosophy of religion in the West is largely concerned with explicating and clarifying\nthe concept of God and life after death, as well as considering the alleged reasons\nfor supposing God exists or that there is life after death. However, in other traditions\nbelief in reincarnation and karma are central beliefs and so questions regarding the\nnature, meaning and justification of the concepts of reincarnation and karma are\nimportant for an Eastern philosophy of religion. In this course, we will examine\nsimilar philosophical questions from Western and Eastern religious traditions as well\nas African, Native American and a variety of other world religions.",

One key idea (Kierkegaard, Heidegger) is that living for the sake of anything social or public alienates an individual from their own lived experience-for example, experience of anxiety about one's finitude. Another key idea is that specific kinds of social relation are alienating, in that they divide an individual internally against themself: Hegel argues that society prior to a modern economy is alienating, but Marx argues that capitalism itself is alienating. Fanon and Beauvoir draw on all this in analyzing racism and sexism. Should we prefer one of these key ideas, both, or neither? ",

One key idea (Kierkegaard, Heidegger) is that living for the sake of anything social or public alienates an individual from their own lived experience-for example, experience of anxiety about one's finitude. Another key idea is that specific kinds of social relation are alienating, in that they divide an individual internally against themself: Hegel argues that society prior to a modern economy is alienating, but Marx argues that capitalism itself is alienating. Fanon and Beauvoir draw on all this in analyzing racism and sexism. Should we prefer one of these key ideas, both, or neither? ",

We\u2019ll then consider several ways that actions done in the context of games and sports complicate this question. What should philosophy of action say about actions we don\u2019t have time to reason about, like whether a batter should swing at a particular pitch? What should we make of group actions, like coordinated efforts by members of a team? Is it possible to violate the \u201cspirit of the game\u201d even while following the rules, and if so can there be objective facts about when this happens? How should we understand cases where we act as a character with different goals and abilities from our own, like in role playing games, and what can these kinds of games teach us about our own decision-making?\"",

All CMC philosophy majors must take at least one advanced seminar, and may take multiple advanced seminars on different topics. Prerequisite: Two previous courses in philosophy. \n\nThe topic for Fall 2021 is \"Ideology and World-Making\" \nMarx famously wrote that the point (of philosophy) is not merely to understand the world but to change it. Of course, one can\u2019t change what they don\u2019t understand. Thus, this class is for those looking to gain a deeper understanding of the various mechanisms that have created the world we inhabit at this moment, so as to better understand what it would take to change our world (for the better!). Topics include ideology, the role of institutions in perpetuating (and disappearing from view) ideology, social construction, and the nature of (social) reality. This course will thus touch on a range of subfields within the discipline of philosophy, including metaphysics and epistemology, in particular. We\u2019ll likely survey a range of thinkers, including (but not limited to) Althusser, Marx and Engels, Barthes, and Foucault, as well as contemporary writing from James Baldwin, Noam Chomsky, Charles Mills, Sally Haslanger, Jason Stanley, and Kristie Dotson, among others.

Examples include white supremacy, patriarchy, land and asset distribution derived from colonial and slave plantation systems. However, markets can also reinforce social justice whether through, for example, community-based development projects or marketable permits for industrial pollution. ",

This seminar will introduce students to the field of political science by placing American and international films in conversation with scholarship on power, politics, and storytelling. Each week we will study a film, read related research, and analyze how one informs our understanding of the other. The course will cover ethnic politics, broadly conceived with a particular focus on civil disobedience, protests and political violence. Related topics may include immigration, crime and the state, and urban politics. We will consider a range of questions including, how do stories influence our sense of self, community and nation? How do filmmaking techniques (e.g. cinematography, casting, sound design) influence which people and issues become salient? How do aesthetic and narrative choices affect attitudes about the social order and who is deserving of power? Through close readings of films, social science, and media studies scholarship, this course will enable students to study key political science concepts, the institution of cinema, and how stories make meaning.

How do they introduce new actors and forms of activism into the political sphere? How do activists frame and mobilize social norms and identities, tap emotions, and build new embodied and virtual networks for political goals, and what makes them succeed or fail? This class explores these questions in comparative context, through cases spanning the Christian Right and AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power in the United States, Arab Spring uprisings in Egypt and Syria, religious and gendered activism in Saudi Arabia, Palestinian militants, and transnational human rights networks.",

We will focus on what the comparative method allows us to know about politics, and study how comparativists pose and answer research questions and approach causality, through case studies, comparative historical analysis, process tracing, discourse analysis, and interpretive methods. Readings will pair methods with literatures on topics like democratization, social movements, ethnic conflict, nationalism, and political violence, and students will produce original research plans. Recommended for students planning to write theses in comparative politics.",

The diffused nature \nof the U.S. political system provides policy entrepreneurs with an opportunity to develop policy \nideas and shape policy outcomes. Students will understand the roles research, expertise, and \nstrategic communications play in shaping public policy. In this class, students will research a \ncontemporary policy issue and develop a policy research brief drawing on existing data sets and \noriginal analysis. The RJI Policy and Issues Briefs will be published quarterly, widely \ndisseminated and posted on the RJI Policy Lab webpage.  \nIn the fall of 2021, the course and lab will focus on environmental justice and environmental \npolicy issues. While the readings cover environmental justice issues widely, we will center our \nanalysis and work around local environmental justice work in the Inland Empire. We will work \nwith the Robert Redford Conservancy to identify relevant partners to provide objective analysis and research in an effort to strengthen the work of advocates seeking to improve the health \nand wellbeing of local residents.

Although infrequent, revolutions have profoundly transformed the political, cultural, and social structures of countries like France, Russia, China, Cuba, and Iran. Utilizing  theoretical models, we will discuss questions like these: is there a universal definition of revolution? Are there common causes for revolutions across time and space? What are the ideological, cultural, and economic origins of revolutions? And finally, why do some revolutions succeed and some fail?",

Topics include democratic institutions, race, gender, class, media, parties, economics, voting behavior, voting rights, public opinion, political culture, and expertise in governing. Throughout we will draw parallels between American politics and social, political, and economic trends in other parts of the world--from advanced industrial democracies in Western Europe to uncertain democracies in Eastern Europe and Eurasia. While we pay particular attention to the elections of 2016 and 2020, we situate those events in a broader historical and global context. ",

It is no longer state-of-the-art to take people away from their work to develop as leaders. Rather, state-of-the-science approaches focus on using ongoing experiences as a way to foster and accelerate leadership development. This unit explores various evidence-and experience-based approaches to developing leaders and leadership. Attention is given to understanding psychological theories and models of change, how to enhance development of human and social capital, conceptualizing and leveraging network perspectives on developing shared leadership capacity, and leading development of self and others at individual and collective levels.\n",

Ultimately, our analyses of understanding and dismantling racism will not only shed light on the complexities of a variety of issues such as racial identities and social structures but will also deepen our understanding of the role of social psychology in our lives.",

The second focus comes in understanding the ways in which Israel has defined itself as a Jewish state, the role of religion in Israeli politics, law, and society, and the challenges to this identity, including the multiple forms of Jewish identity represented in Israel (e.g., secular, Haredi, Mizrahi), and the presence of large numbers of non-Jewish, Arab/Palestinian, citizens.\n",

It tells the story of the great battle between two sets of cousins, the Kauravas and the Pandavas. This class will explore the Mahabharata as a text and a living tradition.\n",

This course will look at the ways in which \"gender\" and \"religion\" interact with various historical and cultural contexts to reinforce, contradict and also resist traditional notions of gender and religious experience. Attention will be paid to how religion affects experiences of gender; and how gender affects experiences of religion. More specifically, we will explore the way in which the intersection of gender and religion affects understandings, experiences and negotiations of religious origins, personal identities, religious experiences, agency, body shapes, images and disciplines, sexuality, race relations, cultural appropriations and power structures.

To explore the multiple relations between ghosts and the machines, topics for the course include:  ghostly visions and magic lantern phantasmagoria; American spiritualism and the telegraph; phrenology and the rise of the archive; psychical research and stage magic; radio's disembodied voices; and spirit photography and therapeutic light therapies; psychic television; magic on film.\n\nHSA Writing Intensive: Yes",

How does this, and Indigenous resistance to American settler colonialism, affect all aspects of social life in the United States? This course will examine the impacts of this ongoing settler colonial nature and Indigenous resistance to it on a variety of aspects of American society, including; relations with the natural world, incarceration, militarism, gender, sexuality, national culture, education, citizenship, racial inequality, capitalism, political power, and social movements. Material will address historical and contemporary dynamics. A sub-theme of the course will be engaging in personal and collective processes of unsettling settler histories, through both a personal / family history project and through participating in a community-oriented interactive educational tool called the Kairos Blanket Exercise. The latter project will also involve working with members of the Tongva community, the original peoples of the Los Angeles Basin.  ",

What is the relationship between economic power, social power, and political power? How do gender, racial, class, and other inequalities inform political activity such as obeying laws and voting? Does the state respond to citizens, serve capitalists, or is it used by bureaucrats? Where and how do citizens engage in politics together and try to create change?  \nPolitical sociology addresses these and other questions. Central to political sociology is the question of how power in society is constructed, legitimated, sustained, and challenged. With a primary focus on the United States, the first half of the fall 2021 version of the course will analyze group power and daily life (including #MeToo and white fragility), white nationalism and the Republican party, fascist politics, and the Democratic party\u2019s changing relationship to working class concerns. The middle part of the class steps back to examine the notion of democracy and the global elite\u2019s ability to coopt resistance through neoliberal ideology. Finally, in the last section of the course students will examine social movements generating radical challenges to current forms of inequality and political power, including Black Lives Matter, the #NoDAPL campaign at Standing Rock, Latinx political power, and the fight for a liveable climate future, specifically examining efforts to promote a Green New Deal. \n",

Much of\nAfrican-American social thought represents different attempts to grapple with American institutionalized racism and its changing face, and the diversity of viewpoints and perspectives we will encounter here will reflect the diverse manifestations of this racism and why being \"woke\" requires more than simply using the term to signify understanding.

There is room for you and your partner abroad\nto develop a relationship through meaningful exchanges on topics of shared personal interest (everyday life, music, art sport, social political issues or events as they unfold in\nboth countries). The purpose of these exchanges is to help you develop confidence and oral proficiency in Spanish and broaden your intercultural understanding from an international perspective. At least two semesters of Spanish or equivalent is required. ",

The course will focus on how current emancipatory thought and practice led by indigenous women has challenged that the ethnocentric andhomogenizing assumptions embedded in certain critical perspectives and feminist traditions. This course will explore a broad range of interdisciplinary theories and studies (across the social sciences and humanities)as well as literary and cinematic representations that have shaped leadership and cultural analysis for indigenous women in Latin America, specifically Peru, Bolivia, Mexico and Guatemala. Along with representation of indigenous peoples by non-indigenous critics or authors, we will also study initiatives of self-representations in testimonio and films in order to analyze how the use of different media hasbecome a key factor for conveying memories of struggle and for the ongoing reformulation of past legacies in the context of the neoliberal era.

Spanish is the official language of the State, and regional languages such as Catalan and Basque are \"co-official\" in their respective territories. In this course we will investigate the linguistic situation of contemporary Spain, learning a range of concepts from the field of sociolinguistics: language standardization; language maintenance and revitalization; language and identity; language policy and bilingual education; and linguistic discrimination. We will also consider the role that language has played in recent debates about Catalonian independence, the status of immigrants in Spanish society, and the relationships among ethnicity, class, and nationhood.

It will look specifically at the ways in which Afro-Latino artists have represented blackness and designed their own subjectivities and agencies. ",

This assumption spurs the extensive introduction of numerical technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data, into contemporary governance, policing, and marketing.

Students will deepen the connection between the truth of their emotional life and how it is expressed vocally and physically. Students will explore voice and speech techniques which will aid them in understanding breath support, resonation, and articulation. The teachings of Michael Chekhov, Keith Johnstone, and Stella Adler will be covered and used as a touchstone as we delve deeper and deeper into scene study. May be repeated twice for credit. Letter grade only. Prerequisites: THEA 001A PO or THEA 001G PO.",

The prolific, 19th century intellectual Karl Marx stated that the philosophers have only interpreted the world. The point, however, is to change it. In this course we will read and write to challenge common assumptions about race, sexuality, gender, class, and memory, among others. We will write about relevant issues that are absent in a world dominated by profit-oriented capitalist ideologies. Our aim will be to construct powerful narratives about the overlooked individual and collective suffering and resilience\nof marginalized peoples. Writing will be used as an instrument of active engagement and remembering to come to terms with the wrongs of the past to envision a more just socio-political order. Additionally, we will integrate multimodal platforms, such as podcasting, into the course with the aim of actively connecting with local and global communities for change. ",

What is the value of a liberal-arts education in an increasingly commodified world? What is the definition and value of diversity in the liberal arts? Are new values\nthreatening to overshadow basic pursuits into knowledge and truth, and is this good or bad? Our examination will translate into working together towards designing, developing, shaping, and polishing clear and detailed compositions. Assignments will likely include debates or mock trials on our main questions, analytical responses to the readings, workshops and reviews of classmates\ufffd compositions, a mission statement for a liberal-arts college, and a defense or critique of a requirement at the Claremont colleges.",

We will read editorials on a variety of topics (some chosen by the class).
